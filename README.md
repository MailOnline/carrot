A Clojure library designed to provide you with the implementation of the following simple RabbitMq delayed retry mechanism:

The idea is the following:

1. Provider sends a message to the message queue
2. Consumer tries to process it
3. While processing some exception is thrown
4. Failed message gets into the waiting-queue for a period of time which can be configured (ttl)
5. After the ttl expired the message is put back to message queue to try to process it again
6. Steps 3-5 repeated until the message successfully processed or until the number of retries are less than the max-retry you running carrot with.
7. When we exceed max retry, we put the message in the corresponding dead-letter queue sorted.

## Usage

No need to worry if the above diagram seems to be too complicated. The idea is that you give custom names to the queues and exchanges you find on the diagram and Carrot will provide you with the retry mechanism and will create the architecturev for you.
Example:
[/blob/master/src/carrot/examples/](example.clj)

```clojure
;;your custom message handler with exception to test retry mechanism with
(defn message-handler
  [{:keys [ch meta payload]}]
  (println (format "[consumer] Received a message: %s"
                   (String. payload "UTF-8")))
  (throw (Exception. "my exception for retry message")))

;;ypurlogger function. It is optional
(defn logger [ & all]
  (log/info all))

;;define ypur exchange and queue names in a carrot config map:
(def carrot-config {:waiting-exchange "waiting-exchange"
                    :dead-letter-exchange "dead-letter-exchange"
                    :waiting-queue "waiting-queue"
                    :message-exchange "message-exchange"})

(defn- main
  [& args]
  (let [conn  (rmq/connect)
        ch    (lch/open conn)
        qname "message-queue"]
    (println (format "[main] Connected. Channel id: %d" (.getChannelNumber ch)))
    ;;declare your carrot system
    (carrot/declare-system ch
                           carrot-config
                           3000
                           "topic"
                           {:durable true})

    ;;declare your queue where you want to send your business messages:
    (lq/declare ch qname {:exclusive false :auto-delete false})
    ;;bind your queue to your main message exchange. Use the same name you defined in carrot system config:
    (lq/bind ch qname "message-exchange" {:routing-key qname})
    (carrot/subscribe ch
                      carrot-config
                      qname
                      ;;user carrot to create the message handler for langohr:
                      (carrot/crate-message-handler-function
                       (carrot/compose-payload-handler-function
                        message-handler
                        ;;here you can en list more functions and they will be threaded in order via threading macro
                        ;;and will compose a message handler function
                        )
                       qname
                       3
                       carrot-config
                       logger)
                      {:auto-ack true})
    (lb/publish ch default-exchange-name qname "Hello World!" {:content-type "text/plain" :type "greetings.hi"})
    (Thread/sleep 20000)
    (println "[main] Disconnecting...")
    (rmq/close ch)
    (rmq/close conn)))
    ```
